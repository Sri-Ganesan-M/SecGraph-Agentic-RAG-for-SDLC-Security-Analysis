# 🔐 SecGraph: Agentic RAG for SDLC Security Analysis

**SecGraph** is an intelligent, modular system that applies **agentic AI** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to perform comprehensive **security analysis across all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**. By assigning specialized agents to each SDLC phase, SecGraph enhances the identification and mitigation of potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.

---

## 🎯 Overview

SecGraph is designed to improve software security by integrating intelligent agents that analyze artifacts specific to each SDLC phase:

- **Requirements**
- **Design**
- **Development**
- **Testing**
- **Deployment**

Each phase has a dedicated agent supported by a custom knowledge base and toolset. Agents interact autonomously using LangGraph, enabling collaborative analysis and secure-by-design recommendations.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Agent-per-Phase Architecture**: Specialized agents for each SDLC phase.
- **RAG-Based Intelligence**: Contextual retrieval from vector databases using ChromaDB.
- **LLM-Driven Analysis**: Uses Google Gemini for code analysis, threat reasoning, and secure design suggestions.
- **Tool Integration**: Each agent is equipped with tools tailored to its phase (e.g., code checkers, document parsers).
- **Persistent Memory**: Agents maintain memory for continuity and contextual understanding.
- **Autonomous & Coordinated Reasoning**: Agents can act independently or collaborate across phases.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **LangGraph** – Agentic framework for orchestrating multi-phase workflows
- **LangChain** – Tool integration, memory, and agent interfaces
- **Google Gemini Pro / 1.5** – Large Language Models for intelligent reasoning
- **ChromaDB** – Vector database for document embeddings and retrieval
- **Python** – Backend development and orchestration

## 🚀 Use Cases

- Secure SDLC assessments  
- Developer assistance during code/design reviews  
- Integration into DevSecOps pipelines  
- Early vulnerability detection and traceability  
- Continuous compliance monitoring

---

## 🔧 Possible Extensions

- Integration with threat modeling frameworks (e.g., STRIDE, DREAD)  
- Real-time IDE plugin support for developer feedback  
- Secure GitOps with commit-level analysis  
- Role-based dashboard for security oversight

---

## 📂 How It Works

1. Input SDLC artifacts (e.g., requirement specs, architecture diagrams, source code)
2. Each agent retrieves context from its knowledge base via RAG
3. Agents analyze the inputs, reason using Gemini, and generate security feedback
4. Cross-phase agents may share context to ensure traceability and deeper analysis
5. Final outputs include structured feedback, risk scores, and improvement suggestions
